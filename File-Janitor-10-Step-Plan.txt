🧹 File Janitor – 10-Step Development Plan

A safe, permission-based Electron app for keeping translation folders (Downloads, Desktop, etc.) clean and organized.
This roadmap prioritizes testing real Windows Task Scheduler integration first, then builds the full cleanup workflow.

1️⃣ Scheduler Test Prototype

Build a minimal Electron app with a single “Schedule Me” button.

Call Windows Task Scheduler (schtasks.exe) via child_process.exec().

Package it with electron-builder.

Verify that the installed .exe can create a real scheduled task for itself.

2️⃣ Scheduler Management UI

Add GUI controls for:

Create Schedule

Run Now

Delete Schedule

View Details

Test each command from the packaged app.

Once this works, your automation layer is ready.

3️⃣ Settings Module

Create a settings panel to:

Select folders to scan

Select quarantine folder

Choose file types to track

Save these preferences in a local settings.json file and confirm persistence between launches.

4️⃣ File-Scanner Engine

Implement Node.js logic to scan selected folders using fs and path.

Filter by:

File extension

Last modified date

Hidden/system file exclusion

Send results to the renderer for display.

5️⃣ Review-First Workflow

Display scan results in the UI.

Prompt users to manually clean files if they prefer.

After manual cleanup, click “Rescan” to refresh and show remaining items.

Ensures users have full control before any automatic action.

6️⃣ Cleanup Actions

Provide buttons for:

✅ Move to Quarantine

❌ Delete Permanently (with confirmation)

⏸ Ignore

Support bulk actions (“Move All”, “Delete All”) with confirmation prompts.

Safely execute operations with fs.rename and fs.unlink.

7️⃣ Quarantine System

Move files to a user-selected quarantine folder with subfolders by file type.

Maintain a small log of moved items.

After N days, prompt daily to review lingering files — never auto-delete.

8️⃣ Optional Undo System

Add a toggle in settings for Undo Log.

When enabled, record file paths for moved/deleted items.

Allow restoring mistakenly moved files.

Keep optional to maintain simplicity.

9️⃣ Dashboard & Reporting

Display:

Scan results

Counts of moved, deleted, and ignored files

Last scan timestamp

Include button to open the quarantine folder.

Clean, text-based interface with no tray notifications.

🔟 Packaging, Testing & Polishing

Package using electron-builder (NSIS).

Test on main and secondary PCs.

Confirm:

Task Scheduler automation works

File cleanup logic runs safely

Refine UI, confirm stable scheduling, and finalize installer.

✅ Summary

Steps 1–2: Confirm Task Scheduler reliability.
Steps 3–7: Build the cleanup core.
Steps 8–10: Add polish, logging, and prepare the release-ready installer.
